The study aims to inform the management of landscape features to promote 'higher quality soundscapes'.","['Biodiversity and/or habitat', 'Vegetation and/or flora', 'Acoustic environment & soundscape']","The study treats the acoustic environment as the primary indicator of park quality, which is shaped by biodiversity and vegetation.
Biodiversity and/or habitat: This was measured as a component of soundscape quality through 'bird call species' and 'bird call species richness'. This was quantified by ""manually identifying all unique bird species vocally-present within each park recording"". The results showed that understory vegetation density had a significant positive association with bird call species.
Vegetation and/or flora: This was analyzed as a key landscape feature influencing soundscape quality. It was measured using LiDAR data to quantify ""the relative density of vegetation in different vertical strata, along with mean canopy cover height"". Specific variables included ""vegetation density (0.15m to 2m)"", ""the (2m to 5m) stratum, along with mean canopy cover height"". The study found that ""greater vegetation density in the understory has a positive influence on the loudness and diversity of bird calls within park soundscapes and a negative influence on traffic noise.""
Acoustic environment & soundscape: This is the central component of quality in the study. Three aspects were quantified: ""traffic noise volume, bird call volume, and bird call species."" Traffic noise volume was measured by ""quantifying the acoustic intensity within the frequency spectrum 1–2 kHz using the average power spectral density (PSD), a measure of sound per unit frequency (dB/Hz)"".

bajwoluk2023.pdf,"The study frames its analysis around the impact of pocket parks on the 'quality of urban space'. It first references a broad definition of the quality of urban structure, stating that it is co-determined by several parts: ""functional (a city's attractiveness and diversity in terms of uses, access to services), spatial (spatial structure integration, a city's compactness, hierarchical form), aesthetic (the cityscape's visual attractiveness, compositional and visual assets, public space aesthetics), technical (infrastructure, technical condition of development, and public spaces), environmental (access to green areas and water, a clean environment), social (intensity of interpersonal contacts, security, a well-developed network of social spaces), and circulatory factors (mass transport efficiency, transport accessibility of key elements of the city's structure, ease of travel, walkability, and bikeability), among others."" From this, the authors selected specific qualitative criteria for their study from two perspectives. From the local perspective, quality is defined by: 1) ""A pocket park's form and function as an indicator of a park's overall utilitarian and aesthetic attractiveness""; 2) ""The development of a pocket park... with consideration of the diversity of greenery forms introduced and a suitably large share of biologically active surfaces within the entire park""; and 3) ""The actual accessibility of each pocket park defined by the pedestrian access isochrone of about 10 min"".

Place identity was measured via the code ""History of use"" (4 comments), with examples like ""‘[I] grew up here and played here as a child so [I am] familiar with it’"" (p. 425). Place attachment was measured via the code ""Emotional attachment"" (3 comments), with examples like it ""‘feels like a second home’"" (p. 425).",[],"No qualifying content was identified. The study's methods and results focus on park users' motivations for visiting and the derived effects of those visits. While negative derived effects related to ""condition of park"" or feeling ""unsafe"" were mentioned, implying management issues, these were not analyzed as a measured dimension of park quality itself, nor were they included in the ""space qualities"" motivation domain."
arnberger2012.pdf,"The study defines quality in terms of 'recreational quality' of public urban green spaces, which is linked to providing 'high-quality recreation experiences for the urban residents'. This quality is presented as something that can be degraded by high visitor use and crowding. The study uses 'recreation quality indicators, such as crowding perceptions, coping behaviors in response to crowding and visitor satisfaction' to assess this quality.",[],"No qualifying content was identified. The study mentions that green spaces support biodiversity and that heavy use can lead to degraded environments, but these aspects were not measured or analyzed as components of recreational quality in the Methods or Results sections.",[],"No qualifying content was identified. The article describes physical features of the park such as its size and number of trails, but these are not measured or analyzed as variables contributing to park quality. The study's focus is on the social-experiential dimension of quality.","['Perceived quality', 'Recreation and/or leisure opportunities or programming', 'Social interactions and/or community-building', 'Other']","The study explicitly frames its investigation around 'recreational quality' and its indicators.
Perceived quality: This is the central component, measured through visitor perceptions of crowding. The Methods section states, 'Perception of crowding was surveyed by asking visitors three questions with the same wording and same evaluative scale but referring to different time periods: “How crowded do you perceive the area ...” ... using a seven-point scale ranging from “1 = far too few visitors” to “7 = extremely overcrowded”.' The study refers to crowding perceptions as a 'recreation quality indicator'.
Recreation and/or leisure opportunities or programming: The quality of the recreational opportunity is assessed through visitor satisfaction. The Methods section states, 'Satisfaction with the area as a recreational setting and with the current Wienerberg visit were asked using a scale ranging from 1 = very satisfied to 5 = very dissatisfied.'
Social interactions and/or community-building: This dimension is treated as a negative aspect of quality, operationalized through crowding. Crowding is defined as 'a negative evaluation of a certain visitor density or number of visitor encounters in a given area'. The measurement of perceived crowding (detailed above) directly assesses visitors' evaluation of the social conditions.
Other (Coping Behavior): The study explicitly identifies coping behaviors as an indicator of recreational quality. The conclusion states: 'This study investigated two indicators of the recreation quality—crowding perceptions and coping behaviors'. This was measured by first asking a screening question, 'Have you ever reacted because of too many people in this green space?'. Visitors who answered affirmatively were then 'provided with a list of nine possible coping behaviors and asked whether they have applied one or more of these. This list contained spatial, temporal, behavioral and activity-related coping mechanisms.'",[],No qualifying content was identified. The study discusses the implications of its findings for 'sustainable urban green space management and city planning' but does not measure or analyze any aspect of management or governance as a dimension of park quality itself.
dobbinson2020.pdf,"The study frames park quality in terms of the amenities available. The abstract states, ""Findings infer improvement of quality, number and type of amenities in degraded parks can substantially increase park use in LSEA."" The introduction refers to parks in disadvantaged areas as having ""fewer and/or poorer-quality amenities"". The conclusion reiterates that ""improvement of the quality, number and type of amenities at degraded parks in low socioeconomic areas may have substantial benefits"".","['Vegetation and/or flora', 'Air quality and/or microclimate']","Vegetation and/or flora: The park refurbishments, which constituted the quality improvement, included adding new vegetation. For example, Dalton Reserve received ""Garden beds and tree plantings"", Wahgunyah Reserve received ""Drought-tolerant garden beds and tree plantings"", and Calder Rise Reserve had ""more trees... planted adjacent to the playground"" and ""More garden beds"" added (Figures 2, 3, and 4).
Air quality and/or microclimate: A key component of the 'ShadePlus' intervention was improving sun protection by modifying the microclimate. The refurbishments included adding ""built shade including a shade-sail for the children's playground"". Specific additions were ""Shade sails added to part of play area and a roofed picnic shelter"" and a ""Rotunda-style roofed shade structure"" (Figures 2, 3, and 4). The effect of this quality improvement was directly measured, as one of the study's primary outcomes was ""the number of people observed using shade"".","['Facilities and/or amenities', 'Design and/or aesthetics', 'Internal accessibility']","Facilities and/or amenities: The core of the intervention was the refurbishment of parks through the addition of numerous facilities and amenities, which the study treats as a quality improvement.

Design and/or aesthetics: The aesthetic quality of the parks was measured as a secondary outcome. The Methods section states that outcomes included ""perceived acceptability of the park refurbishments (as measured by the mean ratings of the aesthetics of park amenities)."" Table 3 reports the results for the ""Park facilities—mean attractiveness rating"" based on intercept surveys with park visitors.
Internal accessibility: The park refurbishments included the addition or extension of paths, improving movement within the parks.

wood2018.pdf,"The study defines and assesses green space quality through two primary components. The first is ecological quality, which is explicitly linked to biodiversity. The abstract states there is reason to expect that ""variations in ecological 'quality' (number of species, integrity of ecological processes) may influence the link between access to green space and benefits to human health and well-being."" The second component is site facilities, which are the non-biological attributes of the park. The abstract describes this as assessing ""the site facilities of the green space (cleanliness, provision of amenities)."" The discussion section summarizes this dual approach: ""We demonstrate that site facilities and ecological (i.e., biodiversity and habitats) quality of parks are positively correlated..."".","['Biodiversity and/or habitat', 'Vegetation and/or flora']","The study treats biodiversity and habitat characteristics as a core component of ecological quality. An 'ecological richness score' was derived from a principal components analysis of four biodiversity variables. These variables were measured as follows:

Biodiversity and/or habitat: The study defined biodiversity as ""an umbrella term for biological diversity than encompasses species richness and the number and diversity of habitats."" It was measured by surveying species richness and habitat structure. Animal species richness was measured by surveying ""Animal species that are likely to be noticed on an everyday visit to parks in the summer (birds, butterflies, and bees)"" along transects. Habitat structure was measured by mapping habitat types (e.g., anthropogenic surfaces, tree cover, amenity grassland, scrub/shrubs, unmown grassland, rough grassland, and waterbodies). From this, ""habitat diversity was then calculated from the percentage cover of different habitats using Shannon's diversity index.""

Vegetation and/or flora: This was measured as part of the overall biodiversity assessment. Plant species richness was measured by sampling ""5 1 m × 1 m quadrats... in each habitat type."" Tree cover was also measured separately: ""Tree cover was estimated by drawing polygons around canopy cover from satellite images"".","['Facilities and/or amenities', 'Maintenance and/or cleanliness', 'Safety and/or security', 'Design and/or aesthetics', 'Size and/or acreage', 'Internal accessibility']","The study measured the physical and functional aspects of park quality using the Natural Environment Scoring Tool (NEST). This tool assesses multiple dimensions which were combined into a single 'Site facilities' score. The specific dimensions measured were:

Facilities and/or amenities: The NEST tool assesses ""'recreational facilities' to availability of features such as playgrounds and sports courts, as well as space for physical activity including walking"" and ""'Amenities' relates to the placement of sufficient seating, bins, and lighting"".

Maintenance and/or cleanliness: The NEST tool measures ""'incivilities' [which] measures anti-social behavior such as littering, graffiti, and signs of alcohol and drug use."" It also assesses ""'natural features' [which] refers to the maintenance and aesthetics of features such as grass and shrubs"".

Safety and/or security: This was measured via the 'incivilities' component of the NEST tool, which includes ""littering, graffiti, and signs of alcohol and drug use,"" and the 'amenities' component, which includes ""lighting.""

Design and/or aesthetics: This was measured via the 'natural features' component of the NEST tool, which ""refers to the maintenance and aesthetics of features such as grass and shrubs"".

Size and/or acreage: Although not part of the NEST score, park area was measured and analyzed alongside the quality variables. ""Habitat maps were then drawn up for each park using ArcGISv10.4.1, in order to calculate the total area"". The area of the parks ranged from 0.14 to 32.56 hectares.

Internal accessibility: The NEST tool assesses ""'Access' [which] refers to entrance points and paths.""",[],"No qualifying content was identified. The study measured social and experiential aspects, such as 'psychological restoration' and 'connectedness to nature', via user surveys. However, these were treated as outcome variables to be predicted by park quality (i.e., biodiversity and site facilities), rather than as components of park quality itself. The study's research questions explicitly frame the relationship this way: ""How are the site facilities and biodiversity of parks related to psychological restoration?""",[],"No qualifying content was identified. The study selected parks that were formally ""managed by a single local government department,"" but this was a selection criterion rather than a measured variable of quality. The study's quality assessment tools (NEST and biodiversity surveys) focused on the physical and ecological outcomes of management (e.g., cleanliness, maintained grass, presence of species) rather than on the management processes, policies, or governance structures themselves."
