Aesthetic: One of the study's main objectives was to determine the extent to which pocket parks affect the quality of urban space via their 'aesthetic... value' (Section 3). The analysis of the parks' form and development was used to assess their 'aesthetic attractiveness' (Section 6). This assessment was informed by secondary data from 'opinion polls conducted by the Municipal Greenery Authority during the design stage of each park and its later construction and use in the form of public consultations' (Section 5).

Educational: The Results section states that, based on field observations, the parks 'were used for educational, cultural, and sports-related purposes' (Section 4). Furthermore, the detailed overview in Table 1 lists 'educational elements' as specific features included in the design of several parks, such as Lipowy, Polny, and Wiewiórkowy.

Use, engagement, recreation: Park use was a directly observed outcome. The Results section reports that 'during the period of original field research, the parks were frequented by large numbers of users who actively engaged with the available furnishing and development elements in these spaces.' The conclusion further notes that 'The observed intensity of the parks' use allows us to assume that the initiative to build them has gained social acceptance' (Section 6).

Equity, environmental justice: The study analyzes the distribution of park access as an outcome of their siting. The methods included a 'graphical analysis of the pedestrian accessibility of each pocket park' using a 10-minute isochrone (Section 4, Figure 3). The results found 'significant differences in the accessibility of each park' and concluded that 'the layout of parks under investigation does not guarantee access to potential users from many multi-family housing complexes,' which constitutes an analysis of equitable access to greenspace (page 11).

Stewardship, education: The study identifies community participation in the park creation process. The Methods section states: 'In every case, local communities participated in the design process. The form, use programme, and general development of a pocket park were determined by means of public consultations' (Section 4). This demonstrates community engagement and stewardship.
