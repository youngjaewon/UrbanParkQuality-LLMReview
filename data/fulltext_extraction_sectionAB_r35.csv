Data collection for this specific analysis occurred in 13 of those sites: ""In 13 sites every third individual was invited to participate...""",Empirical,"The study is empirical as it applies established methods (interviews and qualitative content analysis) to evaluate specific parks and the experiences of their users. The abstract states the study's objective: ""This study sought to examine park users' own reasons for and benefits from green space usage... Conducted in 13 public green spaces in Sheffield, UK, we undertook a qualitative content analysis of 312 park users' responses to open-ended interview questions...""","['Questionnaire surveys', 'Interviews and/or focus groups']","The study used face-to-face interviews that were part of a larger structured questionnaire. The abstract refers to ""open-ended interview questions"". Section 2.2, Data Collection and Procedure, states: ""Two open-ended questions were embedded in an otherwise structured questionnaire... The questionnaire was delivered face-to-face in situ... A project description and assurance of anonymity was provided in writing and verbally prior to the interview.""",['Qualitative Content Analysis'],"The study used qualitative content analysis to interpret the interview data. Section 2.4, Analysis, describes the process: ""Two authors (KNI, SLW) conducted an iterative content analysis. Responses were initially sorted into codes based on participants' language; code names were developed to closely reflect the particular wording used by participants... Codes were clustered into themes. Theme labels were derived from participants' language... Themes were further organized into domains."""
arnberger2012.pdf,Urban Densification and Recreational Quality of Public Urban Green Spaces—A Viennese Case Study,"Arnberger, Arne",2012,Sustainability,Austria,AUT,Vienna,Single greenspace/park,1,"The study focuses on a single recreation area. The Study Area section states: ""The “Wienerberg” recreation area is situated in the south of Vienna, the capital of Austria, in the 10th district (Figure 1). The municipal forest department manages this 120-hectare hilly site that is divided into two sections by a highway.""",Empirical,"The study is empirical as it applies established methods to evaluate a specific park. The abstract states: ""An on-site survey among green space visitors (N = 231) revealed that the majority of them considered the area to be overcrowded on Sundays/holidays and reported a perceived increase in visitor numbers during the past years."" The study's goal is to explore crowding perceptions and coping behaviors in a specific case study area.","['Questionnaire surveys', 'Interviews and/or focus groups']","The study collected data through structured interviews which administered a survey. The Method section states: ""On-site, face-to-face interviews were carried out on eight days between the spring and autumn of 2006."" It further details the survey questions and scales used, for example: ""Perception of crowding was surveyed by asking visitors three questions... using a seven-point scale ranging from '1 = far too few visitors' to '7 = extremely overcrowded'.""",['Quantitative Statistical Modeling'],"The study used several quantitative statistical methods to analyze the survey data. The 'Analyses' section states: ""Stepwise regressions were employed to analyze the influence of past experience and the perception of visitor number increase on the perception of Sunday, workday and actual crowding. ANOVA was used to identify differences between visitors with and without use displacement behavior and crowding-tolerant visitors. Data were analyzed using SPSS."" Pearson correlation was also used."

The abstract states: ""we examined the effects of local government refurbishments to parks (n = 3 intervention; n = 3 comparison) in low socioeconomic areas (LSEA) of Melbourne"".",Empirical,"The study is empirical as it applies established methods to evaluate the effects of a specific park intervention. The abstract states: ""Using a natural experiment, we examined the effects of local government refurbishments to parks (n = 3 intervention; n = 3 comparison) in low socioeconomic areas (LSEA) of Melbourne on park use, health behavior, social engagement and psychological well-being.""","['On-site audit or observation', 'Questionnaire surveys']","The study used systematic observations and self-report surveys. The abstract notes: ""Outcomes were measured via systematic observations, and self-report surveys of park visitors over three years."" The procedure section further details this: ""The observations and intercept surveys were conducted by pairs of research staff at the parks during T1, T2, and T3.""","['Quantitative Statistical Modeling', 'Causal Inference & Experimental Design']","The study uses a natural experiment design to infer causality and quantitative statistical methods to analyze the data. The methods section states: ""We used a natural exposure experiment to examine the broad health-related effects of the ShadePlus park refurbishments at three intervention parks relative to three comparison parks..."" For statistical analysis, it notes: ""The primary analyses were based on t-tests comparing the group difference in mean change in outcomes from T1 to T2 for the intervention parks and comparison parks. ... Effect sizes, measured by Cohen’s d, and 95% CI were calculated."""

The abstract states: ""We selected 12 urban parks for study where we carried out botanical and faunal surveys to quantify biodiversity and assessed the site facilities of the green space..."". The methods section further specifies: ""A total of 12 green space sites (parks and recreation grounds) that met these requirements were located within the Better Start Bradford wards, or had a boundary with the area...""",Empirical,"The study is empirical as it involves collecting and analyzing new data to test a hypothesis. The abstract describes the study's objective: ""We test the relationship between green space quality and restorative benefit in an inner city urban population in Bradford, United Kingdom.

On-site audits were used for park facilities: ""The site facilities within green spaces were measured using a prototype version of the Natural Environment Scoring Tool (NEST...)"". Questionnaire surveys were used for psychological data: ""We also conducted 128 surveys with park users to quantify psychological restoration... Face to face surveys were conducted in English by two interviewers..."". Ecological measurements were taken for biodiversity: ""we carried out botanical and faunal surveys to quantify biodiversity... In order to survey the plant species richness at each site, 5 1 m × 1 m quadrats were sampled... Animal species that are likely to be noticed on an everyday visit to parks in the summer (birds, butterflies, and bees) were also surveyed."" Geospatial data was used for habitat mapping: ""At each green space, habitats were mapped... Habitat maps were then drawn up for each park using ArcGISv10.4.1... Tree cover was estimated by drawing polygons around canopy cover from satellite images...""",['Quantitative Statistical Modeling'],"The study used quantitative statistical methods to analyze the collected data. The 'Statistical Analysis' section states: ""All statistical analysis was conducted in R... Pearson correlations were used to test for associations between different variables... analysis of restorative benefit was done in a two-tiered approach, whereby park level relationships (n = 12) were first considered by using the average restorative benefit across all participants to give a value for each park in linear regression models... a second, complementary analysis was also conducted using the individual-level data (n = 128). This individual-level analysis used linear mixed effects models with the park as the random effect."" The study also used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to handle collinearity."
