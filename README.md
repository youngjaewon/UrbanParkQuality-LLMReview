# UrbanParkQuality-LLMReview
A systematic review of urban park quality metrics, methods, and equity implications using Large Language Models.

This repository supports the project **‚ÄúAssessing Urban Park Quality: A Systematic Literature Review of Metrics, Methods, and Equity Implications.‚Äù** The study investigates how *urban park quality* is defined, measured, and linked to environmental justice across diverse disciplines and contexts. Focusing on studies from **Europe, North America, and Australia**, it synthesizes empirical, methodological, and theoretical work on multiple dimensions of park quality ‚Äî including ecological, physical, social, and governance aspects. The review employs **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to assist with abstract and full-text screening, data extraction, and reliability assessment, following a *human-in-the-loop* framework to enhance transparency and reproducibility in systematic reviews. Searches were conducted in *Web of Science* and *Scopus*, and all inclusion criteria, coding frameworks, and procedures are detailed in the registered protocol below.
